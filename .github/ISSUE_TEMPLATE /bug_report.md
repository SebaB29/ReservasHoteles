## 📝 Description

Briefly describe the problem. Is it a preprocessing error, a model that won't converge, or an issue with the Kaggle submission format?

## 👣 How to Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the notebook `[Notebook_Name].ipynb`
2. Run all cells until: '...' (e.g., the encoding section)
3. See error: '...' (e.g., `ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples`)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen (e.g., the `StandardScaler` should transform the data without changing its shape).

## 📊 Visualizations (if applicable)

If the bug is related to a plot (e.g., a broken Confusion Matrix) or a data distribution issue, please attach a screenshot here.



## 💻 Environment

- **OS:** (e.g. Windows 11, Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel)
- **Python Version:** (e.g. 3.10.x)
- **Key Libraries:** (e.g. scikit-learn 1.2, XGBoost 1.7)
- **Dataset:** (Mention if you are using `hotels_train` or `hotels_test`)
